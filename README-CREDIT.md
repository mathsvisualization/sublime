### Origin & Credit

This project is derived from a Sublime Text setup originally created to support 3Blue1Brown-style workflows. I (shavez) have substantially modified and extended the original setup â€” adding cross-platform support (Windows/Linux), automatic venv activation, Terminus integration, a manim_reload workflow, comment fold/unfold with full-line selection and checkpoint snapshotting, and auto-save before running commands.
